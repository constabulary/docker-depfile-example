# Get Started with Docker

This tutorial is a for non-technical users who are interested in learning more about Docker. By following these steps, you'll learn fundamental Docker features while working through some simple tasks. You'll learn how to:

* install Docker software for your platform
* run a software image in a container
* browse for an image on Docker Hub
* create your own image and run it in a container
* create a Docker Hub account and an image repository
* create an image of your own
* push your image to Docker Hub for others to use

The getting started was user tested to reduce the chance of users having problems. For the best chance of success, follow the steps as written the first time before exploring on your own. It takes approximately 45 minutes to complete.


### Make sure you understand...

This getting started uses Docker Engine CLI commands entered on the command line of a terminal window. You don't need to be a wizard at the command line, but you should be familiar with how to open your favorite shell or terminal, and run basic commands in that environment. It helps (but isn't required) to know how to navigate a directory tree, manipulate files, list running process, and so forth.
